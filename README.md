GitX
---------------

# What is GitX?

GitX is a gitk like clone written specifically for OS X Leopard and higher.
This means that it has a native interface and tries to integrate with the
operating system as good as possible. Examples of this are drag and drop
support and QuickLook support.


# Features

The project is currently still in its starting phases. As time goes on,
hopefully more features will be added. Currently GitX supports the following:

  * History browsing of your repository
  * See a nicely formatted diff of any revision
  * Search based on author or revision subject
  * Look at the complete tree of any revision
    * Preview any file in the tree in a text view or with QuickLook
    * Drag and drop files out of the tree view to copy them to your system
   * Support for all parameters git rev-list has
# License

GitX is licensed under the GPL version 2. For more information, see the attached COPYING file.

# Downloading

GitX is currently hosted at GitHub. It's project page can be found at
http://github.com/pieter/gitx. Recent binary releases can be found at
http://github.com/pieter/gitx/wikis.

If you wish to follow GitX development, you can download the source code
through git:

  git clone git://github.com/pieter/gitx

# Installation

The easiest way to get GitX running is to download the binary release from the
wiki. If you wish to compile it yourself, you will need XCode 3.0 or later. As
GitX makes use of features available only on Leopard (such as garbage
collection), you will not be able to compile it on previous versions of OS X.

To compile GitX, open the GitX.xcodeproj file and hit "Build".

# Usage

GitX itself is fairly simple. Most of its power is in the 'gitx' binary, which
you should install through the menu. the 'gitx' binary supports most of git
rev-list's arguments. For example, you can run `gitx --all' to display all
branches in the repository, or `gitx -- Documentation' to only show commits
relating to the 'Documentation' subdirectory. With `gitx -Shaha', gitx will
only show commits that contain the word 'haha'. Similarly, with 'gitx
v0.2.1..', you will get a list of all commits since version 0.2.1.

# Helping out

Any help on GitX is welcome. GitX is programmed in Objective-C, but even if
you are not a programmer you can do useful things. A short selection:

  * Create a nice icon;
  * Help with the Javascript/HTML views, such as the diff view;
  * File bug reports and feature requests.
