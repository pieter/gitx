v0.7.1
===

This is a maintenance release. The following bugs have been fixed:

* The Tree View now tries to be smart about displaying binaries (Johannes)
* GitX now correctly tries to require git v1.6.0 or higher (Pieter)
* Amending commits if the author name has UTF-8 multi-byte characters now correctly works (Pieter)
* GitX no longer stalls for large periods when refreshing in the commit view (Johannes, Pieter)
* The history view tries to be less crashy when loading commits

In addition, the Sparkle framework has been updated so that future updates will be signed
