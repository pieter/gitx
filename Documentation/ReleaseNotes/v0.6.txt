* Images that have been changed or added in a commit can now be viewed
  inline in GitX

  and disable the Gist and Gravatar integration
* The commit interface is now more intuitive. Particularly, you can now
  select multiple files and use drag and drop to stage / unstage files
* You can now drag and drop files out of the commit view
* The files in the commit view have gained a context menu that allows you
  to revert changes / open the file / ignore the file

* The view shortcuts have changed to use command 1/2 for the history/commit 
  view. The history's subviews can now be changed using command-option-1/2/3
* Listing commits has become much faster
* GitX no longer spawns zombie processes
* GitX now shows a list of files that have been changed in a commit
* GitX now uses libgit2 to store object id's, reducing it's memory footprint

In addition many bugs were fixed, including the correct calculation of a
gravatar MD5 hash.
