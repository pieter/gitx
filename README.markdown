# What is GitX?

GitX is an OS X (MacOS) native graphical client for the `git` version
control system.

GitX has a long history of various branches and versions maintained by
various people over the years. This github org & repo are an attempt to
consolidate and move forward with a current, common, community-maintained
version. See discussion at [**Forking, and plans for the future of
GitX**](https://github.com/gitx/gitx.github.io/issues/1).
